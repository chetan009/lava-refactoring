# submission YAML prototype for connecting to a BBB over ssh
# as secondary connection.
# whichever role is operating as the "host" must specify how to
# authorize connections from other roles using the authorize: key
# in the deployment. This allows the relevant Action to deploy the
# necessary support. e.g. /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
